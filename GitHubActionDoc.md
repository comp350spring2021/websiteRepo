# GitHub Action

The action associated with building and deploying the website can be found [here](/.github/workflows/main.yml).

 In general It works by doing the following when a commit is pushed to the master branch of this repository.
    
* deploy Linux VM
* Setup Hugo project
* Build Hugo Project 
* Use a deploy key, to push the contents of the `/public` directory to our github pages repository.
    * The `/public` directory contains the website files generated by Hugo.


## Setting Up the deploy Key

Because by default our action, can not push code to an external repository. (In this case the `comp350spring2021.github.io` repository) we need to set up a deploy key.

The deploy key acts as a public and private encryption key. I generated the RSA public and private keys on my machine. The secret key, lives as a GitHub Secret on this repository, and the public key lives on the `comp350pring2021.github.io` as a deployment key. You shouldn't need to access the keys, as they are attached to their respective repositories.
