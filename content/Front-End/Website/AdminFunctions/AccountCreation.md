We chose to not apply account creation to the project, but future developments may require such functionality and so, account-create.html could potentially be used as a template. We did modify the UI, but the `<style>` tag is included in the HTML - it is not contained in a separate file.  The UI was simple enough, so we thought it unnecessary to do so.  Future modifications may require a separate file.  The `<style>` and `<form>` tags form the bulk of the page.   You will see that the contents of the page is not too extensive, so modifying the code and verifying the changes made through viewing the webpage shouldn't be too difficult.
