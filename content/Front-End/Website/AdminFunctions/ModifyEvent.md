As of 5/9/2021, we are holding off on featuring the modification of events.  However, the premise of the associated HTML file is such that admin is able to modify an event for every assignment. That is,  the admin would be able to change any combination of properties related to an existing event.  The admin will first choose which assignment they would like to modify, and then be taken to the same steps as create event.  How to execute the modifications as planned is a work in progress and slated for those interested in expanding upon our project.
