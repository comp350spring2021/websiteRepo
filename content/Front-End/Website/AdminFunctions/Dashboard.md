 The purpose of the dashboard was to display assignment information after one was selected from the drop-down 
 menu as well as provide the user the ability to create a new assignment.  When viewing the html file, you will 
 notice elements contained in brackets.  The use of brackets within the html file was a feature related to Django 
 that allowed us to obtain and display assignment information stored in the database, such as the Event Name, 
 Start Date, End Date, etc.  Refer to the Django Information section of our documentation for more details.
