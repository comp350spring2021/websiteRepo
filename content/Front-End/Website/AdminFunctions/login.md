The Admin Login page has not been fully implemented, but the structure of the page has been provdied in login.html.  As was the case for the other html files, the `<style>` tag is not contained in a separate CSS file, and the `<form>` is can be easily modified.  As it stands, the user is required to provide a username and password, otherwise the user will not be able to log in.

# Logout

file: `logout.html`

The other pages has had the log out button removed for the sake of presenting core functionalities on our final submission for the project.  In case the file is used for future development, the HTML page is simplistic, but the security measures needed to ensure that the user has been logged out successfully has yet to be implemented.
