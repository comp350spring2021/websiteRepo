Admin is able to create an event for every assignment.
This will include:

- Event Name and Assignment name.
- Start Date and Due Date.
- Team Size
- Test Cases and Grade Cases.
    - This will be used to run with the python file that students submit.
- List of student emails.
    - This will be used to send the students a message that an event has been created.

Initially, we wanted to create new events that housed different assignments, in the case of a college course or programming competition.  However, as a means to simplify and test functionality, we went with creating new assignments, which was implemented using assign.html, rather than new events that contained assignments, as was the purpose for event-create.html.
