Django is the front end web framework that we chose to write the submitter website with. Django is written in python and makes handling server side requests very easy. To learn more about Django I suggest you go throught the tutorial provided in the django documentation linked [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/). This will take some time however, it will greatly help your understanding of the submitter website.
